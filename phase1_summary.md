# Phase 1 Summary: Project Samarth Dataset Discovery

## What We Found

Successfully cataloged **10 high-quality datasets** from data.gov.in and IMD covering Indian agriculture and climate data:

### Agriculture Datasets (5)
- **District-wise crop production** (2001-2014) - PRIMARY TARGET
- State-wise crop estimates with area/production/productivity
- Agricultural statistics compendium 
- National crop trends (1950-2014)
- Minimum support prices

### Climate Datasets (5)
- **District-wise rainfall normals** (1951-2000) - PRIMARY TARGET  
- State-wise monthly rainfall (1901-2015) - LONG TERM SERIES
- IMD gridded rainfall (requires registration)
- All India monsoon trends
- CHIRPS fallback dataset

## Highest Priority Datasets

**Top 5 for immediate ingestion:**

1. **District wise Season wise Crop Production** - Contains district/state/crop/year/area/production - perfect for crop yield analysis
2. **District wise Rainfall Normal** - Monthly rainfall by district - essential for climate-crop correlations  
3. **State wise Monthly Rainfall** - 115-year rainfall series - critical for long-term climate trends
4. **State wise Crop Estimates** - State-level aggregated production data with productivity metrics
5. **Agricultural Statistics at a Glance** - Comprehensive agricultural statistics in Excel format

## Access Blockers

### IMD Restrictions
- **IMD Gridded Rainfall Data**: Requires registration at IMD website and approval process
- **Contact**: imdpune@gmail.com for data access requests
- **Alternative**: CHIRPS satellite rainfall data available as fallback

### Data Quality Notes
- Most data.gov.in resources are publicly accessible (HTTP 200 OK)
- Some datasets may have outdated URLs - validation needed during ingestion
- Excel files require special handling for multiple sheets

## Suggested Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 2)
1. **Run ingestion scripts** to download accessible datasets
2. **Standardize schemas** - create common district/state codes mapping
3. **Data quality assessment** - check completeness, outliers, missing values
4. **Create sample joins** between crop production and rainfall data

### Short-term
1. **Register with IMD** for gridded rainfall access
2. **Implement CHIRPS processing** pipeline for district-level rainfall aggregation
3. **Add more recent data sources** (post-2015 datasets)
4. **Create data validation rules** for crop-climate consistency checks

### Medium-term  
1. **Build canonical ETL pipeline** with automated updates
2. **Implement data lineage tracking** 
3. **Create API endpoints** for standardized data access
4. **Add satellite-derived crop area** datasets (MODIS, Sentinel)

## Technical Notes
- All scripts include proper error handling and logging
- CSV inventory follows exact schema requirements
- Sample data extraction implemented for accessible resources
- Fallback datasets identified for restricted IMD data
